## Databricks ETL (Extract Transform Load) Pipeline


**ETL Process Overview**

Effectively harnessing vast datasets from diverse sources is crucial for extracting valuable insights in analytics, data science, and machine learning endeavors. Data engineering teams assume a pivotal role in this endeavor, orchestrating the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to convert raw, unstructured data into refined, dependable information.

### How ETL Works

In the first stage, data is gathered from a wide array of sources, ranging from business systems and APIs to sensor data and databases. This data may exist in structured or semi-structured formats, such as JSON server logs. The extraction methods employed depend on the nature of the source:

Partial Extraction: This method is applied when the source system signals changes in records, allowing for the extraction of only the modified data.

Partial Extraction (with update notification): In cases where systems explicitly identify altered records, this method is utilized to selectively extract the updated information.

Full Extract: When systems lack the capability to recognize changes, necessitating a comprehensive data extraction, the full extract approach is adopted. A reference to a previous extraction copy is crucial for pinpointing alterations in the dataset.

**ETL Data Pipeline**

A data pipeline serves as a series of meticulously orchestrated processes, facilitating the seamless flow of data from source systems, its transformation to meet specific criteria, and eventual storage in a designated target system. This systematic approach transforms raw data into a format suitable for data analysts and scientists to glean insights and conduct meaningful analyses. A quintessential illustration of a data pipeline is the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workflow, wherein data is extracted from source systems, undergoes transformation to adhere to quality and structural requirements, and is then loaded into a chosen target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake.

To construct a data pipeline within the Databricks platform, the following steps can be undertaken:

1. Leverage Databricks features to comprehensively explore the raw dataset.
2. Create a dedicated Databricks notebook to ingest raw source data and seamlessly store it in a predefined target table.
3. Develop another Databricks notebook specifically for transforming the raw source data, ensuring it aligns with quality and structural specifications, and subsequently store the transformed data in a designated target table.
4. Formulate a Databricks notebook designed for querying the transformed data, facilitating thorough analysis.
5. Institute automation in the data pipeline by utilizing Databricks jobs.
6. These steps presuppose that the user is logged into Databricks, has access to a cluster, and, if applicable, has configured a catalog and schema in Unity Catalog for the potential publishing of tables.

### Data Lake

A data lake serves as a centralized repository housing extensive data in its original raw form. Differing from a hierarchical data warehouse that organizes data in files or folders, a data lake adopts a flat architecture utilizing object storage. Object storage associates data with metadata tags and unique identifiers, simplifying data retrieval across regions and enhancing overall performance. Leveraging cost-effective object storage and open formats, data lakes empower numerous applications to harness and benefit from this wealth of data.
